Let's explore how to build a speech recognition system using statistical models and then deep learning models. 

The end goal of this project is to have a public facing interface that does speech recognition with an option to switch between models. By completing this project, I hope to gain a better understanding of statistical and dl models in the realm of speech recognition, a better understanding of the challenges of building ai related projects and refine my engineering and software development skills.

So very roughly the project is broken down into 3 parts: 
- Build a Statistical model
- Build a DL model 
- Build an Interface
