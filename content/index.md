Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Amen Tamrate Abshir. I am a software engineer based in Ottawa, Canada where I went to school and got my BSc in Computer Engineering. My current interests include: MLOps, NLP, CV, Document AI, Diffusion models ... (all things AI basically). In this website, I intend to share my projects, my building and learning process, and my thoughts on varying topics.
